"Ep: 9: Block Scope & Shadowing in JS";
/*
 * { }: Block
 * Block / Compound Statement: Combining multiple JS statements, in a block, that we can use it where JS expects one statement.
 
 * Block Scope: Variable, fxns access in the block.
 * 'let' & 'const' are blocked scope. 
eg: 
    {
        var a = 10;
        let b = 100;
        const c = 1000;
        console.log(a, b, c);
    }
    console.log(a)
